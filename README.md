# Turing Research Agent

A **multi-agent research assistant** built on **LangGraph**, the **DeepAgents** harness, a **provider-switchable LLM layer** (Anthropic Claude **or** Groq Llama), **FastAPI** with SSE streaming, persistent **Supabase Postgres** checkpointing, and a **React + Vite + TS + Tailwind** frontend.

Four specialized agents collaborate to research companies, validate findings, and synthesize answers — with a human-in-the-loop interrupt when the query is unclear, durable multi-turn memory across server restarts, and a Validator → Research feedback loop capped at 3 attempts.

> Interview deliverable for the LangGraph multi-agent coding exercise. See [`Beyond Expected Deliverable`](#beyond-expected-deliverable) for choices that go past the spec.

```

The compiled graph is wrapped in a LangGraph checkpointer keyed on `thread_id`. The checkpointer is selected at startup:

- **No `DATABASE_URL`** → `MemorySaver` (zero-config, lost on restart)
- **With `DATABASE_URL`** → `AsyncPostgresSaver` (Supabase / Neon / any Postgres) — threads survive restarts, can be shared across workers

**Key design decisions**

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **Selective DeepAgents** — only the Research agent uses the harness | Research is genuinely open-ended (mock lookup? Tavily? scratch notes?). Wrapping classifier-style agents (Clarity, Validator, Synthesis) in deep agents is overkill. Engineering judgment, not framework name-dropping. |
| **Provider-switchable LLM** — `LLM_PROVIDER=groq \| anthropic` | One env var flips the entire stack. Local dev on free Groq; production on Claude Sonnet 4.5 for quality. Agent code is provider-agnostic via `agents/base.py`. |
| **Async checkpointer** — `AsyncPostgresSaver` with `AsyncConnectionPool` | `graph.astream()` needs async checkpoint methods. Sync `PostgresSaver` raises `NotImplementedError` for `aget_tuple`. We open the pool once at FastAPI startup. |
| **Informed validator loop** — feedback string drives next Tavily query | When the validator marks findings insufficient, its feedback (`"no information on CEO; search 'Apple Tim Cook tenure'"`) is fed verbatim as the next Tavily search query. The loop converges instead of cycling. |
| **Validator contradiction guard** — regex-based `_resolve_contradictions` | Small models occasionally return `sufficient` with feedback that describes a gap. We catch this with a `_NEGATION_PHRASES` regex (e.g. "no information", "missing", "could not find") and flip to `insufficient` automatically. |
| **Anchored confidence scoring** | LLMs drift toward `7-8` for any plausible output. The confidence prompt has explicit anchors (`≤3 if specific fact missing`) and uses the fast model to save tokens. |
| **Two-model strategy** | Fast model (Haiku 4.5 / Llama 3.1 8b) for Clarity, Validator, and confidence scoring. Primary model (Sonnet 4.5 / Llama 3.3 70b) for Research planning + Synthesis. |

## Agents in detail

Four specialized agents. Each is a class with a single `__call__(state) -> dict` entry point. **Agents never call each other directly** — the graph orchestrates the handoff and they communicate purely through `ResearchState` mutations. This keeps testing simple (stub one, observe the others) and makes the dataflow auditable.

### 🧠 Clarity Agent — disambiguates the user's request

**Job**: decide whether the query specifies a concrete company. If yes, route to Research. If no, route to the interrupt node so the user can clarify which company they mean.

**Inputs read from state**: `user_query`, `messages` (full conversation history — so follow-ups like "What about their CEO?" resolve correctly without a fresh clarification).

**Outputs written to state**: `clarity_status` (`"clear"` or `"needs_clarification"`), `company_name` (canonical name when clear), `clarification_question` (the prompt shown to the user when not).

**Implementation** — `agents/clarity.py`: fast model + `with_structured_output(ClarityDecision)` for deterministic JSON. The system prompt explicitly allows pulling the company name from prior turns, which is how the multi-turn memory demo short-circuits Clarity straight to the clear path.

**Error handling**: any LLM exception returns `needs_clarification` with a friendly fallback message ("Could you tell me which company you'd like me to research?") — the graph never crashes on Clarity failures.

**Routes to**: `clarification` node (interrupt) if `needs_clarification`, else `research`.

### 🔍 Research Agent — gathers facts about the company

**Job**: produce structured findings about the company (recent news, stock info, key developments) plus a self-rated confidence score (0–10) so the router knows whether to invoke the Validator.

**Inputs read from state**: `company_name`, `user_query`, `validation_feedback` (when looping back — drives the next Tavily query), `attempts`.

**Outputs written to state**: `research_findings` (dict with `company`, `recent_news`, `stock_info`, `key_developments`, `source`, `raw_notes`), `confidence_score`, increments `attempts`, appends an AIMessage to `messages`.

**Tool selection — cascading fallback chain** (see `_run_deep_agent_or_fallback`):

1. **DeepAgents harness** — when `ENABLE_DEEPAGENT=true`, the agent autonomously picks tools, plans with `write_todos`, iterates. Off by default (token-heavy).
2. **Informed Tavily search** — when `validation_feedback` is present, runs Tavily with `"{company} {feedback}"` as the query, then augments the mock baseline. This is the *informed loop*.
3. **Direct mock lookup** — first-attempt path when the company is in the curated dataset.
4. **Generic Tavily search** — fallback when the company isn't in the mock and no validator feedback exists.
5. **Stub** — last resort when no source returns results; sets low confidence so the validator fires.

**Confidence scoring**: a separate fast-LLM call with an anchored prompt (see `_CONFIDENCE_PROMPT` — explicit floors like `≤3 if specific fact missing`, `8-9 only if comprehensive`). The scoring uses the *fast* model so it doesn't burn the primary model's token budget.

**Routes to**: `validator` if `confidence_score < 6`, else `synthesis`.

### 🕵️ Validator Agent — quality gate for findings

**Job**: judge whether the research findings actually answer the user's *specific* question. When insufficient, write an **actionable** feedback string (`"no information on current CEO; search 'Apple Tim Cook tenure'"`) — the next Research pass uses that string verbatim as its Tavily query. The loop is informed, not blind.

**Inputs read from state**: `user_query`, `research_findings`, `confidence_score` (as a prior), `attempts`.

**Outputs written to state**: `validation_result` (`"sufficient"` or `"insufficient"`), `validation_feedback`.

**Reliability features baked in**:

- **Few-shot prompt** — 3 worked examples bias small models toward consistent verdicts (see `_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `validator.py`).
- **Confidence-anchored** — receives Research's confidence score so it doesn't independently re-judge the same thing from scratch.
- **Contradiction guard** (`_resolve_contradictions`) — small models occasionally return `"sufficient"` paired with feedback that documents a gap. We catch this with a `_NEGATION_PHRASES` regex (`"no information"`, `"missing"`, `"could not find"`, etc.) and **automatically flip** to `insufficient`. A `_POSITIVE_HEDGE` regex prevents false positives like `"no further info needed"`.
- **Safe default on error** — any LLM exception returns `"sufficient"` so the graph doesn't loop infinitely. The 3-attempt cap is the backstop.

**Routes to**: `research` if `insufficient` AND `attempts < 3`, else `synthesis` (cap-hit case is acknowledged in Synthesis's output).

### ✍️ Synthesis Agent — writes the user-facing answer

**Job**: turn raw findings into a polished Markdown answer that **directly addresses** the user's specific question, citing sources inline.

**Inputs read from state**: `user_query`, `research_findings` (both structured fields **and** `raw_notes` — critical because the informed-loop Tavily data lives in `raw_notes`, not the structured fields), `messages` (multi-turn context), `attempts`, `validation_result` (to detect cap-hit cases).

**Outputs written to state**: `final_answer` (Markdown string), appends an `AIMessage(name="synthesis_agent")` to `messages`.

**Prompt discipline** (from `_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `synthesis.py`):

- Lead with the direct answer in 1-2 sentences. No "Here is what I know about X" preambles.
- 2-4 supporting bullets, each citing the source inline (`"per curated data"` / `"per live web search"`).
- **Never invent specifics** (names, dates, numbers) not in the inputs. If the user asked "who is the CEO" and there's no CEO info, say "I don't have current leadership data" — don't guess.
- Acknowledge cap-hit cases explicitly: *"Some details may be incomplete — here's what's available:"*
- Reference prior turns naturally on follow-ups.

**Emergency fallback** (`_emergency_fallback`): when the LLM itself fails (rate limit, network error, parse exception), formats the raw findings as a clean Markdown answer with citations + a banner explaining what happened. The user always sees research data, never a stack trace.

**Routes to**: `END`.

## Tools available to agents

The "tools" here are the LangChain `@tool`-decorated functions exposed to the Research Agent. The other three agents are tool-less — they're pure structured-output LLM calls.

| Tool | Defined in | Used by | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lookup_mock_company(company: str)` | `tools/research_tool.py` | Research | Case-insensitive + alias-aware lookup against the curated 6-company dataset (Apple, Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, Amazon — plus tickers like AAPL, TSLA, MSFT). Returns `{found, company, recent_news, stock_info, key_developments, source: "mock"}`. Deterministic, instant, zero LLM tokens. |
| `tavily_search(query: str)` | `tools/research_tool.py` | Research | Live web search via Tavily. Active only when `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set. Returns top-5 results plus Tavily's own answer summary. The informed-loop path constructs the query from validator feedback (e.g. `"Apple current CEO Tim Cook tenure"`). Returns `{found: false, source: "stub"}` when Tavily key is absent — the agent gracefully degrades. |
| `write_todos` (built-in) | `deepagents` package | Research (only when `ENABLE_DEEPAGENT=true`) | DeepAgents' planning tool. Lets the Research agent write a checklist of sub-tasks and tick them off as it iterates over multiple tools. |
| Virtual filesystem — `read_file`, `write_file`, `ls`, `edit_file` (built-in) | `deepagents` package | Research (only when `ENABLE_DEEPAGENT=true`) | Scratch-pad workspace for the DeepAgent during multi-step research. Unused in the lightweight fallback path. |

**Tool selection is deterministic in the fallback path** — the code (in `research.py:_run_deep_agent_or_fallback`) walks the cascade `mock → informed-tavily → generic-tavily → stub`. **Tool selection is LLM-driven in the DeepAgents path** — the agent reads its system instructions (`_RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS`) and picks tools itself, including chaining them.

## Quickstart

You need **one** LLM key — either Groq (free) or Anthropic (paid, higher quality). Recommended: Anthropic for the demo, Groq for free testing.

### Option A — Local Python + Node

```bash
# 1. Install
make install                     # backend venv + frontend npm install

# 2. Configure
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env, set EITHER:
#   LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OR:
#   LLM_PROVIDER=groq + GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-...
# Optional:
#   TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...      (live web search fallback)
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (persistent threads)

# 3. Run (two terminals)
make dev-backend                 # uvicorn on :8765
make dev-frontend                # vite on :5173
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>.

### Option B — Docker Compose

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your LLM key

docker compose up --build
```

### Option C — CLI demo (no frontend)

```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/python -m examples.demo_conversation
```

Both example turns from the spec — vague query → interrupt → clarification → answer; follow-up → memory used.

### Why port 8765 (not 8000)?

The macOS ChatGPT desktop app's "Work with Apps" feature aggressively probes localhost:8000 and can intercept browser requests. We moved the backend off 8000 to dodge that conflict. If you want the standard port, change `BACKEND_PORT` in `.env` and `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/.env.local` to match.

## Try these in the UI

Two sets of suggested-query chips are pinned under the chat — each exercises a different graph path:

### ↻ Validator loop · stable-fact queries

These ask for facts the mock dataset doesn't have, so Research returns low confidence → Validator fires → loops back with Tavily.

| Chip | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| Apple HQ location | Validator loop · Tavily augmentation |
| NVIDIA founded year | Validator loop · stable historical answer |
| Microsoft + LinkedIn | Validator loop · multi-fact answer (date + amount) |
| Google's parent | Validator loop · entity disambiguation |
| Amazon's founder | Validator loop · biographical |
| Tesla first car | Validator loop · product history |

### ❓ Clarify / interrupt · vague queries

These have no obvious single company — Clarity flags them, the graph interrupts, you reply with a specific company name, the graph resumes.

| Chip | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| That EV company | Interrupt + resume (could be Tesla, BYD, Rivian, Lucid) |
| The big chip maker | Interrupt + resume (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, TSMC) |
| That cloud giant | Interrupt + resume (AWS, Azure, GCP) |

### Multi-turn memory demo

After the first turn completes, send a follow-up that omits the company name — *"What about their stock?"* / *"Tell me more"*. The Clarity Agent reads the conversation history, infers the company, and skips the interrupt.

### Persistence demo (requires `DATABASE_URL`)

1. Send a query → wait for answer
2. `pkill uvicorn` → restart the backend
3. Refresh the browser → conversation rehydrates from Supabase

---

## Frontend — visible internals

Every important piece of internal state is surfaced in the UI so reviewers can narrate the system from the screen:

| Surface | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Agent Activity timeline** (collapsible) | Live pills per node invocation. Each pill carries badges: confidence (`c=8`), attempt counter (`#1`), validation tick (`✓` / `↻`), elapsed ms |
| **Routing decision labels** under each pill | Names the backend routing function + verdict, e.g. `route_after_validator → insufficient · attempt 1/3` |
| **Validator feedback inline note** | When the loop fires, renders the validator's actual feedback string above the chat — proves the loop is *informed*, not blind |
| **Thinking bubble** | Live "typing indicator" with the current node label (🔍 *Researching Tesla · attempt 2*) — bouncing dots, ARIA-busy |
| **Graph topology SVG** (left sidebar) | Static 4-node diagram with the active node pulsing |
| **Dev Inspector** (left sidebar, tabbed) | `State` (full ResearchState snapshot) · `Messages` (LangChain message history) · `Events` (raw SSE event log with timestamps + colors) |
| **Clarification banner** | When `interrupt()` fires, an amber banner appears with the question + inline text input that hits `/chat/resume` |
| **Conversation export** | One button → downloads the entire turn history as Markdown |
| **Dark mode** | `prefers-color-scheme` detection + localStorage override |

## API

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | — | `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `POST` | `/chat` | `{thread_id, message}` | **SSE stream** of node events |
| `POST` | `/chat/resume` | `{thread_id, clarification}` | **SSE stream** (resumes interrupted thread) |
| `GET` | `/threads/{thread_id}` | — | Checkpointed history + interrupt status |

### SSE event types

```jsonc
{ "type": "node_start",    "node": "clarity" }
{ "type": "node_end",      "node": "clarity",
  "state_delta": { "clarity_status": "clear", "company_name": "Tesla" } }
{ "type": "interrupt",     "question": "Which company are you asking about?" }
{ "type": "final_message", "content": "## Tesla\n- …" }
{ "type": "error",         "message": "LLM service unavailable" }
```

`node_start` fires for **every** invocation including loopback iterations — so a Research → Validator → Research → Validator → Synthesis pass produces five `node_start` events.

### Manual probe

```bash
curl -N -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"thread_id":"demo-1","message":"Where is Apple HQ?"}' \
  http://localhost:8765/chat
```

---

## Tests

```bash
make test                            # backend pytest + frontend typecheck
```

**42 tests passing in ~0.2s** (deterministic, no network):

| File | Cases | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `test_routing.py` | 17 | All branches of all 3 conditional routing functions, parametrized |
| `test_state.py` | 2 | State seeding contract |
| `test_mock_data.py` | 14 | Case-insensitive lookup + alias resolution |
| `test_agents.py` | 5 | Agent contracts with mocked LLM, including LLM-error fallbacks |
| `test_graph_e2e.py` | 4 | Real LangGraph + stub agents: happy path, validator loopback, attempt cap, interrupt/resume |

CI re-runs the same on every push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

### Step 1 — Backend → Railway (~5 min)

1. <https://railway.app> → New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
2. **Critical**: open the *service* (not the project) → **Settings** → **Source** section → set **Root Directory** = `backend`. Without this, Railpack scans the repo root, sees no Dockerfile, and fails with *"Railpack could not determine how to build the app"*.
3. Variables tab — add (use rotated keys, never the ones from shared chat transcripts):

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `LLM_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` |
   | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `sk-ant-...` |
   | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | `tvly-...` (optional) |
   | `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://postgres.<ref>:<pw>@aws-X-region.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres` |
   | `CORS_ORIGINS` | `https://<your-app>.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173` (update after step 2) |

4. If the first build doesn't trigger after the Root Directory change, force one: `git commit --allow-empty -m "rebuild" && git push`.
5. Watch the Deploy log; success line:
   ```
   Backend started | provider=anthropic | tavily=on | persistence=postgres | models=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
   ```
6. Service Settings → **Networking** → **Generate Domain** → copy the `https://<service>.up.railway.app` URL.
7. Verify in a browser: `https://<service>.up.railway.app/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Step 2 — Frontend → Vercel (~3 min)

1. <https://vercel.com/new> → Import your GitHub repo
2. **Critical**: in the "Configure Project" screen, click **Edit** next to Root Directory → set to `frontend`. Without this, Vercel shows "Other" framework preset (no Vite detection) because it's scanning the repo root.
3. Once Root Directory is `frontend`, Framework Preset auto-flips to **Vite** and the build commands auto-fill correctly — leave them alone.
4. Environment Variables → add:

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `https://<your-railway-domain>.up.railway.app` |

   ⚠️ **Must start with `https://`**. If you paste just the bare domain (no protocol), the browser treats it as a relative path and your `/chat` request becomes `https://<your-vercel>.vercel.app/<railway-domain>/chat` — which Vercel's SPA rewrite catches and returns `index.html`, triggering `Expected content-type to be text/event-stream, Actual: text/html`.
5. Deploy. ~60-90s. Vercel gives you:
   - A **stable production URL** like `https://<project>.vercel.app` (always points to latest deploy — use this)
   - A **per-deployment hash URL** like `https://<project>-<hash>.vercel.app` (changes per deploy)

### Step 3 — Wire Railway CORS to Vercel

Back in Railway → Variables → edit `CORS_ORIGINS`. Whitelist **both** the stable and hash URLs so deploys keep working:

```
https://<project>.vercel.app,https://<project>-<hash>.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173
```

Railway auto-redeploys (~30s).

### Step 4 — Verify end-to-end

Open the **stable** Vercel URL → click a chip → DevTools Network tab:

| Field | Expected |
|---|---|
| Request URL | `https://<your-railway>.up.railway.app/chat` (railway host, not vercel) |
| Status | 200 |
| Content-Type | `text/event-stream` |

Then send a query and watch the timeline animate live.

### Deployment gotchas we hit (in chronological order)

These are documented because every one of them cost time. Skip the pain:

1. **Root Directory must be on the SERVICE, not the PROJECT.** Railway's project settings page has Members, Webhooks, Tokens — none of which set the build path. You need to click *into* the service first.
2. **`$PORT` in `startCommand` must be wrapped in `sh -c`.** Railway exec's the command directly (no shell), so `--port $PORT` is passed to uvicorn literally as the string `"$PORT"`. Our `railway.toml` uses `sh -c '... --port ${PORT:-8000} ...'` for this reason.
3. **Postgres password must be URL-encoded or alphanumeric.** Special chars (`@`, `:`, `}`, `%`) inside the password break URL parsing — psycopg fails with *"failed to resolve host"* because the parser splits at the wrong `@`. Easiest fix: reset Supabase password to alphanumeric-only.
4. **Use Supabase Session Pooler, NOT Transaction Pooler.** Transaction Pooler (port 6543) disables prepared statements that LangGraph relies on; Session Pooler (port 5432) works.
5. **`healthcheckTimeout` should be ≥60s.** When the DB connection is misconfigured, psycopg's pool takes 30s to time out and fall back to MemorySaver. Railway's default 30s healthcheck fires first and marks the deploy failed even though startup recovers right after.
6. **`VITE_API_BASE_URL` must include `https://`.** Bare domains become relative paths.
7. **Vite bakes env vars at BUILD time.** Setting a new value after deploy doesn't take effect until you **Redeploy** (Vercel dashboard → Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy).
8. **Allow both Vercel URLs in `CORS_ORIGINS`** — the stable production URL AND the hash-suffixed deployment URL. Otherwise preview deploys hit CORS errors.

### Why not Vercel for the backend?

Vercel Serverless Functions cap at 10–30s — kills SSE streams. Vercel Edge supports streaming but is awkward for FastAPI. Railway (or Fly.io) are the right shape.

### Supabase setup (for `DATABASE_URL`)

1. <https://app.supabase.com> → New Project. Region close to Railway.
2. Set a strong DB password — Supabase shows it once. Save it. **Use only alphanumeric** to avoid URL-encoding issues with `@`, `:`, `}`, `%`, etc.
3. Click **Connect** at the top of the dashboard → **Session Pooler** tab (NOT Transaction Pooler — that breaks LangGraph's prepared statements) → copy the URI.
4. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your DB password.
5. Set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.<ref>:<pw>@aws-X-region.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres` in Railway.
6. On first boot, the checkpointer's `setup()` creates `checkpoints`, `checkpoint_blobs`, `checkpoint_writes` tables in the `public` schema (idempotent; subsequent boots catch the `UniqueViolation` and continue).

### Production hardening (called out, not all in v1)

- ✅ Persistent threads via Supabase Postgres
- ✅ Provider switch (Groq ↔ Anthropic) with one env var
- ✅ Async checkpointer for proper SSE support
- ✅ Emergency fallback when LLM rate-limits or errors
- ⏳ Add `slowapi` rate limiting on `/chat` and `/chat/resume`
- ⏳ Front the API with Cloudflare for caching + abuse blocking
- ⏳ Add Sentry on both sides for error visibility
- ⏳ Restrict CORS to exactly the prod domain; remove `http://localhost:5173`
- ⏳ Scale beyond 1 worker now that the checkpoint is the shared source of truth

## Assumptions made

1. **Confidence score is LLM-assigned** with a strict anchored prompt — but no calibration dataset. Threshold `≥6 = sufficient` is spec-driven.
2. **Tavily is optional.** Without `TAVILY_API_KEY` the Research agent falls back to mock-only.
3. **Max 3 research attempts** is enforced in `route_after_validator` (code, not LLM).
4. **`MemorySaver` is the default**; Postgres is opt-in via `DATABASE_URL`. Production demos use Postgres for durability.
5. **Thread IDs are client-generated UUIDs**, no auth/user model.
6. **DeepAgents is off by default** (`ENABLE_DEEPAGENT=false`) — its 5–6 LLM calls per Research turn blow through the Groq free tier (12k TPM). The Research agent has a direct mock + Tavily fallback that uses 1–2 calls per turn. Set `ENABLE_DEEPAGENT=true` to opt in if you have budget headroom.
7. **Two-model strategy**: fast model for classifiers, primary model for generation.
8. **Error handling on LLM boundaries** falls back gracefully — Clarity → asks user to clarify; Validator → defaults to `sufficient` (avoids infinite loops); Research → low-confidence stub; Synthesis → emergency Markdown fallback that still cites the research data.
9. **macOS port collision**: the ChatGPT desktop app probes `localhost:8000`, so we default to `:8765`.

## Beyond Expected Deliverable

Items that go past the spec:

1. **Selective DeepAgents harness** — Research uses `deepagents.create_deep_agent`; classifiers don't. Toggleable via `ENABLE_DEEPAGENT`.
2. **Provider-switchable LLM layer** — `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic|groq`. Same agent code, different provider. Demonstrated by `agents/base.py:_build_chat_model`.
3. **AsyncPostgresSaver + Supabase** — durable threads survive restarts; same code works with any Postgres.
4. **Idempotent Postgres setup** — `_resolve_contradictions`-style guard around `setup()` so subsequent boots don't fail on `UniqueViolation`.
5. **Live SSE agent timeline** with pulsing active-node animation, attempt counter, validation tick, elapsed ms per step.
6. **Routing-decision labels** under each pill — names the routing function + verdict (e.g. `route_after_validator → insufficient · attempt 1/3`).
7. **Validator feedback inline note** — shows the loopback driver right above the chat.
8. **Validator contradiction guard** — regex catches `sufficient + negation in feedback` and flips automatically.
9. **Validator few-shot prompt** — 3 worked examples bias small models toward consistent verdicts.
10. **Informed loop** — validator's feedback string is fed as the next Tavily query, not just appended to context.
11. **Confidence-anchored prompt** — explicit floors (`≤3 if specific fact missing`) prevent score inflation.
12. **Synthesis reads `raw_notes`** — Tavily search results in raw_notes flow into the final answer instead of being lost behind structured fields.
13. **Synthesis emergency fallback** — rate-limit / LLM-error path produces a clean Markdown answer with citations rather than a raw exception.
14. **Thinking bubble** — live "typing indicator" in the chat with node-specific labels.
15. **Two-section suggested-query chips** — Validator-loop chips + Clarify-interrupt chips, color-coded.
16. **Dev Inspector** — tabbed State / Messages / Events panel showing the raw SSE wire protocol.
17. **Graph topology SVG** — visual reinforcement of the routing.
18. **Collapsible Agent Activity** — keep the timeline visible during demos, hide it for max chat real-estate; choice persisted in `localStorage`.
19. **Conversation export to Markdown** — one-button download.
20. **Dark mode** with system-preference detection + override.
21. **Persistent thread restore** — `GET /threads/{id}` rehydrates after refresh AND after backend restart (with Postgres).
22. **End-to-end type safety** — Pydantic backend + mirrored TS types.
23. **Tested routing matrix** — all 17 branches parametrized + 4 e2e graph scenarios.
24. **One-command Docker Compose** for reviewers without Python/Node.
25. **Railway IaC + Vercel config** committed.
26. **GitHub Actions CI** — ruff + pytest + tsc + vite build.
27. **Error matrix** — 10 distinct failure modes have explicit code paths (Groq 5xx, Tavily timeout, structured-output parse failure, unknown thread, etc.).

## Tech stack rationale

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Graph | `langgraph` (StateGraph + AsyncPostgresSaver) | Explicit routing, interrupt, checkpointing — the spec's hard requirements |
| Agent harness | `deepagents` (Research only, opt-in) | Open-ended reasoning needs planning + multi-tool; classifiers don't |
| LLM (primary) | `langchain-anthropic` → Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Best generation quality; large daily quota |
| LLM (fast) | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Cheap classifier-tier calls |
| LLM (alt) | `langchain-groq` → Llama 3.3 70b / 3.1 8b | Free tier for local dev / CI |
| Persistence | Supabase Postgres + `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` | Managed, free tier; standard psycopg connection string |
| Live search | Tavily | Optional; falls back to mock cleanly |
| Backend | FastAPI + SSE (`sse-starlette`) | Long-lived streams; clean async |
| Frontend | React + Vite + TS + Tailwind | Modern, lightweight, fast HMR |
| Frontend state | Zustand | Tiny, no Redux ceremony |
| SSE client | `@microsoft/fetch-event-source` | Handles POST + SSE (native EventSource is GET-only) |
| Hosting BE | Railway | No cold starts; $2/mo on free credit |
| Hosting FE | Vercel | Edge CDN; PR previews; Vite-native |
